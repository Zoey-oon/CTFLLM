CRYPTOGRAPHY CHALLENGE: {challenge_name}
Description: {challenge_description}
Files: {files_list}

Your task: Analyze the encryption/encoding, decode the data step by step, and find the flag in picoCTF{{...}} format.
Note: You may find wrapped (picoCTF{{content}}) or unwrapped (content) flags - wrap unwrapped content as picoCTF{{content}}.

Common crypto challenge types:
- Classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigen√®re, substitution)
- Base64/hex encoding (often layered)  
- XOR encryption
- Modern crypto (RSA, AES) with known weaknesses
Start by examining the provided files and identifying patterns or encoding schemes.
