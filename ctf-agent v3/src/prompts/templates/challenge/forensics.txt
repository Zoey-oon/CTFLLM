FORENSICS CHALLENGE: {challenge_name}
Description: {challenge_description}
Files: {files_list}

Objective:
Investigate digital evidence, recover hidden information, and extract the flag.

Relevant Knowledge (reference):
- File systems: structure, permissions, and logs
- Memory forensics: dumps, processes, and artifacts
- Network forensics: packet captures, protocols, and traffic analysis
- Metadata analysis: timestamps, EXIF data, and embedded comments
- Steganography: detecting and extracting hidden data in images or audio files
- Data carving: recovering deleted or embedded content from binary data

Common Tools & Techniques (illustrative):
- File inspection: file, strings, hexdump, xxd
- Metadata analysis: exiftool, stat
- Binary analysis: binwalk, foremost, dd
- Network analysis: Wireshark, tcpdump, tshark
- Memory forensics: Volatility, strings
- Steganography: steghide, zsteg, stegsolve
- Text/Pattern search: grep, regex-based filters

Common Task Patterns (illustrative):
- Metadata extraction: recover hidden comments, EXIF fields, or timestamps
- Steganography: extract hidden data from images or audio files
- Network analysis: trace sessions, reconstruct files, or locate credentials
- Memory analysis: recover process data, encryption keys, or injected code
- Data carving: extract embedded archives or split binary payloads
