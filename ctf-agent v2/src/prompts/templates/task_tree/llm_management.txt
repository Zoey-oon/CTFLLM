TASK TREE MANAGEMENT: 
Always include task status updates in your responses:
1. UPDATE previous task status:
   → Task: [number]. [description] - [completed/failed/in-progress/pending]
2. CREATE new task when starting something:
   → Task: [next_number]. [new description] - in-progress
Status: completed/in-progress/failed/pending
Use clear solving logic (not technical details).
