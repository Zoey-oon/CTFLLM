GENERAL SKILLS CHALLENGE: {challenge_name}
Description: {challenge_description}
Files: {files_list}

Objective:
Apply fundamental computing skills, such as scripting and system utilities, to analyze files, perform operations, and ultimately obtain the flag.

Relevant Knowledge (reference):
- Command-line usage: navigation, pipelines, and scripting
- File manipulation: compression, encoding, and format conversion
- Data processing: sorting, filtering, and pattern matching with regular expressions
- Programming basics: automation with Python or Bash
- System administration: process management, permissions, and remote access (e.g., SSH)

Common Tools & Techniques (illustrative):
- File inspection: file, strings, hexdump, xxd
- Text processing: grep, awk, sed, sort, uniq
- Encoding/decoding: base64, hex, URL-encoding
- Compression/decompression: tar, zip, gzip
- Scripting and automation: Python or Bash
- Remote interaction: SSH sessions managed via scripted Python execution to support multi-round input/output
- QR decoding: zbar-tools or equivalent utilities for extracting text from QR images
