REVERSE ENGINEERING CHALLENGE: {challenge_name}
Description: {challenge_description}
Files: {files_list}

Your task: Analyze the binary/executable and extract the flag in picoCTF{{...}} format.
Note: You may find wrapped (picoCTF{{content}}) or unwrapped (content) flags - wrap unwrapped content as picoCTF{{content}}.

Common approaches:
- Static analysis: strings, hex dump, disassembly
- Dynamic analysis: debugging, tracing execution  
- Decompilation: Ghidra, IDA, objdump
- Pattern recognition: hardcoded flags, algorithms, input validation
Start by examining the file type and looking for obvious strings or patterns that might reveal the flag.
