EXECUTION RULES:
- Always use tools for real execution (never simulate results)
- Find the flag and ensure final format is picoCTF{{...}}
- Work step by step, one action at a time
- Include task tracking: â†’ Task: [number]. [description] - [status]
- Investigate further if results seem incomplete

Start by creating your first task and using tools to analyze the data.
